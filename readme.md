## RPC over RabbitMQ using AMQP

In general, doing RPC over RabbitMQ is easy. A client sends a request message and a server replies with a response message. In order to receive a response the client needs to send a 'callback' queue address with the request.

 * When the client starts up, it creates an exclusive callback queue.
 * For an RPC request, the Client sends a message with two required properties: `reply_to`, which is set to the callback queue and `correlation_id`, which is set to a unique value for every request.
 * The request is sent to an `rpc_queue` queue.
 * The RPC worker (aka: server) is waiting for requests on that queue. When a message appears, it does the job and sends a message with the result back to the Client, using the queue from the `reply_to` field.
 * The client waits for data on the callback queue. When a message appears, it checks the `correlation_id` property. If it matches the value from the request it returns the response to the application.
